## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Minh, I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of New South Wales focusing on the application of Deep Learning in Clinical Research. 

ðŸ’¬ Tech stack: Python, R, and Javascript (For some reason, I know a bit of Groovy)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently using Large Language Models, Image Segmentation/Processing to develop analysis methods for Electronic Medical Records, Microscopic Images, Clinical Trial Description from cancer patients. 

ðŸ‘¯ I collaborate with clinician/oncologist (I can understand their language) and bioinformatician (I am actually bioinformatician) to develop new packages (or improve exisiting libraries) for computational models in precision oncology.
